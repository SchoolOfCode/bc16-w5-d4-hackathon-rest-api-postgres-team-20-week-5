### The Zombie Movie Database

Zombies, for reasons both morbid and fascinating, have captured the imagination of audiences since the early days of cinema. The genesis of zombie films can be traced back to the eerie presence of 'White Zombie' in 1932, a pioneering film that delved into the realms of voodoo and the undead. However, it was George A. Romero's groundbreaking masterpiece 'Night of the Living Dead' in 1968 that truly defined the modern conception of zombies.

Throughout the following decades, zombies shuffled their way through various iterations, from Romero's sequels like 'Dawn of the Dead' to comedic spins like 'Shaun of the Dead.' Each film added layers to the mythos of the undead, exploring themes of survival, morality, and the fragility of human civilization in the face of apocalyptic scenarios.

the history of zombie films is a testament to humanity's enduring fascination with the macabre and our collective anxieties about mortality and societal collapse. As the genre continues to evolve and adapt to changing times, one thing remains certain: zombies will continue to haunt our screens and our nightmares for years to come.
